# Optimizing Inventory Turnover Using Predictive Modeling for Seasonal Demand

## Overview

This project aims to optimize inventory management by developing a predictive model that forecasts seasonal demand fluctuations.  The analysis focuses on reducing excess inventory holding costs by 15% within six months. This is achieved through the application of statistical modeling techniques to historical sales data, enabling more accurate inventory planning and reducing unnecessary storage costs. The project leverages Python's data science ecosystem to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model training, and result visualization.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including details about the chosen model, its performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE), and the predicted demand for upcoming seasons.  Additionally, the project generates several visualisations, including:

* `sales_trend.png`: A line plot visualizing historical sales trends, highlighting seasonal patterns.
* *(Other plot files may be generated depending on the specific analysis)*:  These plots aid in understanding the data and evaluating the model's performance.  These files will be saved in the project's directory.
